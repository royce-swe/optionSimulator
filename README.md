# ðŸ§  Option Pricing Simulator

A powerful and interactive GUI-based tool to visualize and simulate option prices using cutting-edge stochastic models. Built with Python and Tkinter, this project offers financial insight for students, researchers, and enthusiasts.

## ðŸ“ˆ Features

- **Black-Scholes Model** â€“ Classic closed-form pricing for European call and put options.
- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** â€“ Simulates asset price paths using standard stochastic processes.
- **Heston Model** â€“ Captures stochastic volatility with mean-reverting variance.
- **SABR Model** â€“ Incorporates stochastic volatility with asset price correlation; used for complex derivatives pricing.
- **American Option Monte Carlo Simulation** â€“ Uses Longstaff-Schwartz regression to simulate early exercise behavior and optimal stopping.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Matplotlib (Plotting)
- NumPy, SciPy
- scikit-learn (for regression in Monte Carlo)

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/royce-swe/optionSimulator.git
